This was a project based off a tutorial for learning to create a Gatsby powered blog.  :disappointed:  Unfortunately, I lost the link to the tutorail.  If you know where this tutorial is from, please let me know.

It was a great learning experience with this.  It was my first foray into server-side rendering and was very informative.  I still plan on using Gatsby as the basis of a blog site if I ever get time to really dig into it :laughing:
